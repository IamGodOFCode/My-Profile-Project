        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>Despite being born into a poor family, my parents somehow managed to get me admission into an English medium school. This allowed me to develop a good command of the English language. When I was 15 years old, my parents bought me a computer, which marked the beginning of my journey in the field of website development.</p>

        <p>I started by creating HTML-based websites using the site builder Wapka.mobi. This was a fun and easy way for me to learn the basics of website development. Initially, I had no intention of becoming a website developer, but I was just doing it for fun and to learn new things. With Wapka, I learned many things about website development. However, everything changed when HTML5 was introduced. That was when my real learning journey began. Now, I am pursuing further knowledge in website development through TreeHouse.</p>
